# fetch-fic

This is a tool that can both turn fanfic from various sources into epub,
ready for your ereader, but it can ALSO take your freshly written fanfic and
prepare it for sharing easy peasy.

## IMPORT FICS FROM:

* Any [Xenforo](https://xenforo.com/) based forum, like: [spacebattles.com](https://forums.spacebattles.com/), [sufficientvelicity.com](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/), [questionablequesting.com](https://questionablequesting.com)
* [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/)
* [Fanfiction.Net](https://www.fanfiction.net/)
* Local Scrivener save files/folders (tested on Mac).  Scriviner sources may
  contain bbcode, which will be rendered appropriately across outputs.
* Local folders full of rtf files

## IMPORT OTHER STUFF FROM:

* [Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/) (for linked fanart)
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
* [Youtube](https://youtube.com) (included as a thumbnail image linked to the video)
* [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com) & Wordpress Facebook Avatar Mirror (for forum avatars)
* Generic image handling– any url ending in jpg/jpeg/png/gif/svg will be
  accepted and included in an `<img>` tag.  Added primarily to allow
  links to images to be included in the Externals section.

## EXPORT FICS TO:

* epub – Ready for ereadering.
* bbcode – Ready for posting to various forum sites.
* ao3 – Ready for uploading to Archive of Our Own
* ffnet - Ready for uploading to FanFiction.net
* html – Ready for whatever else you come up with!

## NOTABLE FEATURES

* Support for cover images, both as ebook cover and in title pages.
* Can generate a numbered table of contents.  (Non-chapter content is
  numbered with roman numerals.)
* Images contained in the fic are brought into the final ebook.  (This
  includes smilies on Xenforo sites.)
* Xenforo threads that lack threadmarks can still be imported.
* Links between chapters are maintained and become links within the ebook
  itself.
* External links to other supported sites will optionally be added
  automatically as appendices and the links to them updated to stay in the
  ebook. This can give you a fully offline reading experience.
* Include chapter names as headings at the start of each chapter (if the
  original author didn't bother to do this).
* Content is aggressively cleaned for broad compatibility and for quality of
  display in ereaders.
* Messy Xenforo content is restyled for ebook use:
  * Spoiler boxes are styled as boxes w/o the "Spoiler" button.
  * Quoted text is styled without the "Expand/Collapse" buttons.
  * White-text is de-whited.
  * Invisitext is shown
  * mailto: links are delinked.
  * Colors are converted to a not-to-light grayscale with text decoration to
    indicate hue.
* Content is cached so that iterating to get the perfect config takes no
  time. And when a new chapter is posted only that has to be fetched.

## INSTALLATION

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to use this tool.  Once you have
that, installation is pretty simple:

```console
$ npm install -g fetch-fic
```

## EXAMPLE USAGE

If you just want to make an epub:

```console
$ ff get https://archiveofourown.org/works/8811952/chapters/20204071
expiation.fic.toml
$ ff gen expiation.fic.toml
expiation.epub
$
```

If you want to get the latest chapters of a fic you got previously:

```console
$ ff up expiation.fic.toml
expiation.fic.toml
    Updated fic last update time from Sat Dec 10 2016 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST) to Sat Dec 17 2016 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
    Added 1 new chapters
$ ff gen expiation.fic.toml
expiation.epub
$
```

I typically edit the fic file before running `ff gen`, as I have Opinions
about how things should be organized that don't always mesh with the
author's.  =D

For publishing, you can start with:

```console
$ ff get /path/to/directory/full/of/rtf
$
```

But be aware that since we have nearly nothing to work from, you'll have to
edit that a lot. Once you have, you can prepare it for publishing with:

```console
$ ff gen my-fic.fic.toml -o ao3
my-fic
$
```

Which generates a directory full of HTML suitable for using on Archive of
Our Own. Other options are `ffnet` for FanFiction.net, `bbcode` for posting
to forum sites, and `html` for non-site specific HTML.

## HINTS

* The fic files just text, open them up in an editor and they're pretty straightforward.
  For the technically minded, they're strictly speaking [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).
* I often edit the fic files quite a bit.  The title determines the name of
  the output file.

## DETAILED USAGE

If you run `ff` without anything else, it'll show you a summary of available
commands.

```
Usage: ff <cmd> [options…]

Commands:
  get <url>          Get chapter list for a fic
  update <fic...>    Update fic with latest chapter list           [aliases: up]
  generate <fic...>  Generate epub (or other) from fic       [aliases: get, gen]
  cache-clear <url>  Remove a URL from the cache

Options:
  --help   Show help                                                   [boolean]
  --debug                                                              [boolean]
```

You can see the help screens for any of these commands by including
`--help`.  For example, `ff get --help` shows something similar to the following:

```
Usage: ff get <url>

Options:
  --scrape                      scrape the index instead of using threadmarks
                                                                       [boolean]
  --and-scrape                  pull chapters from BOTH the index AND the
                                threadmarks                            [boolean]
  --xf_user                     the value to set the xf_user cookie to, for
                                authenticating with xenforo sites       [string]
<url> – The URL or path to a fic that you want to create a chapter list file
for. With a chapter list file you can create epubs and other things.
```

The scraping options are currently only used on xenforo sites where instead
of looking at the threadmarks it'll look for links within the post and turn
those into chapters.  This is necessary for older fics that predate the
threadmark system, it's also handy for fics that include omake and other
goodies in their first post but not in their threadmarks. To sum up:

* Use `--scrape` if the thread doesn't have threadmarks but has an index post.
* Use `--and-scrape` if the thread has extra stuff in the index post that's
  not threadmarked.  This is commonly where omake/meta-fanfic and fanart go.

```
Usage: ff update <fic…>

Options:
  --add-all                     if true, merge ALL missing chapters in instead
                                of just NEW ones      [boolean] [default: false]
  --add-none                    if true, add no new chapters, just update other
                                metadata              [boolean] [default: false]

<fic…> - One or more fic metadata files to update the chapter info for.
Filenames end on `.fic.toml`.

```

By default `ff update` will look through the freshly fetched chapter list
and add them from the bottom up until it finds one already in your chapter
list.  This lets you trim chapters and not have them re-added when you run
`ff update`.  Still, that's not always the right thing and you can use
`--add-all` to add ALL chapters missing from your existing fic file.

Update will also update modification times and word counts.

```
Usage: ff generate <fic...>

Options:
  -o, --output                  Set output format
           [choices: "epub", "bbcode", "html", "ao3", "ffnet"] [default: "epub"]

<fic> - A fic metadata file to fetch a fic for. Typically ends in .fic.toml
```

## EXPERIMENTAL BITS

There are some experimental bits that work for me but may or may not be
complete enough just yet to work for you.

* The `rtf` importer is distinctly incomplete, notably it's missing tables
  and stylesheets.  (But also tons of other less common things.) This
  doesn't impact my writing but YMMV.  I ended up writing my own because the
  other options available to me either didn't support how Scriviner closes
  underlines or didn't support unicode.  So it at least does those things
  right.  =p
* The `bbcode`, `ao3` and `ffnet` outputters are still veeery fresh code and
  probably need some more laps around the yard before they're really done.
  `style` attributes ARE supported, but `style` tags are not (yet).  The
  style translator is incomplete and a bit buggy. On the plus side, the HTML
  translator is probably very close to complete. The integration between the
  CSS translator and the HTML translator needs some work too.

Still, all that said, they're getting the job done for me, vastly reducing
the effort to post new fic chapters.

## CACHE

Yes, this thing has a cache.  It creates `~/.fetch-fic` (on Windows it does
something...  not entirely nonsensical, but you'll still get a dot file like
that).

In `~/.fetch-fic` you'll find compressed copies of everything `fetch-fic`
has ever downloaded.  If you remove the cache folder then `fetch-fic` will
recreate it on its next run but should otherwise work correctly (albeit more
slowly).

Nothing is ever expired from the cache, so it can get pretty big (mine
weighs ~1GB, but I also download an absurd amount of fic).

## COMMAND LINE OPTION REFERENCE

The tool will take any link to any page of a thread.  If you intend to
scrape it should be a link to the index page.

The last line printed is the filename of the epub file it created for you.
This is produced from the thread title.

### --xf_user <cookie>

Used by: `ff get`, `ff update`, `ff generate`

You can optionally pass the value of your `xf_user` cookie if you want to
download threads that are restricted to members of the site.  To get this
cookie you'll have to look in your browser. It's a pain ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The good news is that once you've done this for `ff get` you shouldn't need it
when doing `ff update` or `ff gen`.

### --scrape

Used by: `ff get`, `ff update`

If included then instead of fetching threadmarks we'll slurlp links from the
URL you specified and count those as chapters.

Your use of this with `ff get` will be remember and `ff update` will
automatically do the same.  If you want to stop `ff update` from following
along you can pass `ff update --no-scrape`.

### --and-scrape

Used by: `ff get`, `ff update`

Fetch threadmarks AND slurp links from the URL you specified. Often results in
duplicates but it's also often the only way to get _everything_.

Your use of this with `ff get` will be remember and `ff update` will
automatically do the same.  If you want to stop `ff update` from following
along you can pass `ff update --no-and-scrape`.

### --output

Select the output format for `ff generate`.  This defaults to `epub`, but can
produce directories of files in `bbcode` and `html` formats.  Additionally
and can produce HTML specifically designed for import into Archive of Our
Own (`ao3`) and FanFiction.net (`ffnet`).

### --add-all

Modifies `ff update`'s behavior when updating an existing `.fic.toml` file.
Ordinarily it will only add chapters NEWER then the oldest chapter already
in your metadata file. If you pass in `--add-all` then it will add ANY chapter
missing from your `.fic.toml` file, no matter how old.

### --add-none

Makes `ff update` not add ANY new chapters, only update word counts and
other metadata.

### --cache
### --no-cache

Used by: `ff get`, `ff update`, `ff generate`

Allows you to control if the cache is used.  For `ff get` and `ff update` we
skip the cache when fetching the chapter list to ensure that you get an
up-to-date copy of the index.  You can force the use of the cache with
`--cache`.

For `ff generate`, you can disable the cache (and redownload all your
chapters) with `--no-cache`.

Gross technical details: By "skipping the cache" we mean that we send an
`If-Modified-Since` header and use the cached content on a `304` response.
Ordinarily if we find something in the cache we'll just use it.  Note that
many of the sites we support don't support If-Modified-Since queries, so
disabling the cache for them is tantamount to requesting a fresh copy of
everything.

### --requests-per-second=num

Used by: `ff get`, `ff update`, `ff generate`

The maximum number of network requests that will be made per second.  This
defaults to `1` which seems to avoid everyone's flood protection, but if you
know you're fetching from a site that allows it then increasing this can
make fic downloading a lot faster.

This operates on a per site basis, so if you have a fic sourced to multiple
sites it'll download one chapter per second from each site.  This is
intended to spare the sites, not your local 'net connection.

### --concurrency=num

This defaults to `6`, which is what most web browsers use.

Set the maximum number of simultaneous network requests to a single domain
that we'll do at a time.  This limitation works in conjunction with
`requests-per-second` and with default settings does not typically come into
play.  For example, if you set `requests-per-second` to `5` then this limit
would only be used if the site was taking greater than 200ms to reply (and
thus the requests-per-second limitation was allowing us to have ANY
concurrent requests).

### --debug

Used by: All commands

Enables debugging.  This makes errors print stack traces instead of just
messages and makes those stack traces extra long.

### --no-network

Used by: `ff get`, `ff update`, `ff generate`

Error if anything tries to access the network (on a cache-miss).  Note that
`--no-cache` and `--no-network` used together are guaranteed to error out.


## WHAT FIC FILES LOOK LIKE

`ff read` produces `.fic.toml` files…

If the original thread name was:

```
My great threadname (Example1/Example2)
```

then:

```toml
title = "My great threadname"
author = "Example Author"
authorUrl = "https://forums.example.com/members/example-author.123/"
created = 2016-09-25T01:11:36Z
modified = 2016-10-02T03:17:23Z
link = "https://forums.example.com/threads/example.12345/"
description = """
This is an example taken from the long and great tradition of examples.
What this actually is, is the first paragraph from the fic.  If we're very
lucky the it'll be a summary to sell folks on reading it.  Most of the time
it's the fic title or something else equally unhelpful.  Still.  It's better
than what used to be here.
"""
tags = ["Example1", "Example2"]

[[chapters]]
name = "1"
link = "https://forums.example.com/posts/7890"
created = 2016-09-25T01:11:36Z

[[chapters]]
name = "2"
link = "https://forums.example.com/posts/9783"
created = 2016-10-02T03:17:23Z
```

Sometimes you might have a single thread that contains multiple stories.
While `ff read` will never produce a file like this, `ff generate` will
produce multiple separate epubs if you give it something like this:

```toml
title = "My great ideas thread"
author = "Example Threadcreator"
authorUrl = "https://forums.example.com/members/example-author.123/"
created = 2016-09-25T01:11:36Z
modified = 2016-10-02T03:17:23Z
link = "https://forums.example.com/threads/example.12345/"
description = ""


[[fics]]
title = "This first story"
author = "Example Author"

    [[fics.chapters]]
    name = "1"
    link = "https://forums.example.com/posts/7890"
    created = 2016-09-25T01:11:36Z

    [[fics.chapters]]
    name = "2"
    link = "https://forums.example.com/posts/9783"
    created = 2016-10-02T03:17:23Z

[[fics]]
title = "A second story"
author = "Another Author"

    [[fics.chapters]]
    name = "1"
    link = "https://forums.example.com/posts/32433"
    created = 2016-09-25T01:11:36Z

    [[fics.chapters]]
    name = "2"
    link = "https://forums.example.com/posts/838233"
    created = 2016-10-02T03:17:23Z

```

# FULL DOCUMENTATION FOR `.fic.toml` PROPERTIES

## Top level properties

### id

Optional.  Defaults to `link`.  An identifier string representing this piece
of fiction.  This is not generally visible in any document you create.  It's
used in conjunction with the modified date for epub's to produce unique IDs.

### title

**Required.**  The title of this piece of fiction.  In addition to being placed
on the title page and included in any metadata, this is also used to
generate the output filename.

### link

Optional. The URL from which this fiction was fetched. This is filled in as the
`source` in an epub and is included on any title pages.

### updateFrom

Optional.  Defaults to `link`.  This is the URL or directory that the
fiction was fetched from.  This is used when updating existing fic metadata.

### author

Optional.  The name of the author of this work.  This is displayed on the
title page and included in available metadata.

### authorUrl

Optional.  A URL to a profile page for the author of this work. Not used unless
`author` is also set.

### created

Optional. The date that this work was originally published.

### modified

Optional. The date that this work was most recently modified.

### publisher

Optional.  The name of the website or other publisher where this work was
found.  This is used for non-user visible metadata.

### description

Optional.  HTML.  A few paragraphs providing a "back of the book" type
description for new readers. This is included in the title page and metadata.

### cover

Optional.  The URL of an image file to embed as the cover of this work. 
(Alternatively, this can be a filename, but it'll be relative to where you
run `ff generate`, which is not great.)

### chapterHeadings

Optional.  Default: false.  If true then chapters will have headings added
to the top of them with the name of the chapter and, if different than that
of the work as a whole, the author.  Often desirable on fics from [Archive
of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) as it does this too.

### externals

Optional.  Default: true.  If true then any links to external sources that
`fetch-fic` understands will be added as appendices.

### words

Optional. The number of words in this work. This is used on the title page.

### tags

Optional.  Any tags associated with this work.  This is included on the
title page and the metadata.

### includeTOC

Optional.  If true then a Table of Contents page will be generated and injected at the start of the fic.

### numberTOC

Optional.  If true then the navigation version of the table of contents will have numbers before each item.

### fetchMeta

If true and this is a xenforo based source then threadmarks will be used to
get the index when updating. This is additive with `scrapeMeta`.

### scrapeMeta

If true and this is a xenforo based source then the index page will be
scraped for chapters when updating. This is additive with `fetchMeta`.

## [[chapters]]

### name

Required.  Must be unique.  The name of the chapter, as it will appear in
the index and any chapter headings.

### link

Optional.  The URL from which this chapter was fetched. This is used in the
`bbcode` output index. This is also used if `fetchFrom` is missing to fetch
the content of the chapter.

### fetchFrom

Optional. Default: `link`. The URL or path to the content of a chapter.

### created

Optional. The date that this chapter was originally published.

### modified

Optional. The date that this chapter was most recently modified.

### author

Optional. The name of the author.  Ordinarily this is only used if
different then that of the work's author.

### authorUrl

Optional.  A URL to a profile page for the author of this chapter.  Not used
unless `author` is also set.  Ordinarily this is only used if different then
that of the work's authorUrl.

### tags

Optional. Tags associated with this chapter. Currently not used for anything.

### externals

Optional.  Default: true.  If true then any links to external sources that
`fetch-fic` understands will be added as appendices.  Overrides any
work-level setting.

### headings

Optional.  Default: false.  If true then a heading will be inserted at the
top of the chapter with the name of the chapter and, if different than that
of the work, the author. Often desirable with omake.

### words

Optional. The number words in this chapter. Used in some indexes.

## [[fics]]

These sections can be used to create multiple output files from a single
`.fic.toml`.  These sections have all of the same properties as the top
level.  Additionally, any not specified will default to the values given
at the top level.  (So, for example, if you don't have an `author` property
under `[[fics]]` then it will use the value you had at the top level.)

## [[fics.chapters]]

A chapter within a subfic. These have exactly the same properties as `[[chapters]]`.

# TODO

Stuff I'd like to see (user visible):

* A web UI
* Make the rtf handler more complete.
* Better stylesheet handling when outputting to formats that don't support
  them, eg, ao3, ffnet, bbcode.
* More external site support:
  * Don't want to support every fic site ever, but…
  * More image sources for externing would be useful.
  * If generic wikia support is possible that would be super useful.
  * … relatedly, generic mediawiki support might be possible?

## LIMITED XENFORO TESTING

While in principle this should work with most any XenForo site, it's only
been tested with the following:

* https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com
* https://forums.spacebattles.com
* https://forum.questionablequesting.com

Currently it will warn if you use it with another site.

## OTHER OPTIONS

* [FanFicFare](https://fanficfare.appspot.com/) ([as Calibre plugin](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221))
  is a great general tool.  It is missing a few of the less "ficcy" sites
  that `fetch-fic` supports, eg Deviant Art, Wikipedia, Youtube, etc, but it
  supports a whole slew of sites that `fetch-fic` likely never will.  The
  command line version can also *update* an existing epub.  (`fetch-fic`
  doesn't support this (yet), but outside of absurdly huge fics, it can
  recreate them as fast as it could update them.)
  [(Python)](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare)
* [ficrip](https://ficrip.io/) is specialized for fanfiction.net currently
  and supports some things not found elsewhere, for instance using the
  associated image as a title page. [(Ruby)](https://github.com/toroidal-code/ficrip)
* [FicSave](http://ficsave.xyz/) supports fanfiction.net and a few more
  obsure sites.  [(PHP)](https://github.com/waylaidwanderer/FicSave)
* [Leech](https://github.com/kemayo/leech) supports ffnet, ao3, xenforo
  sites, deviant art and sta.sh.  It makes some different formatting
  choices, of particular note is displaying spoilers as footnotes (which
  show up as popup windows in ereaders). [(Python)](https://github.com/kemayo/leech)
* [fetch_story](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/WWW-FetchStory/scripts/fetch_story)
  is another command line tool that supports a whole slew of sites that the
  others don't. In addition to the big one's that everyone supports (AO3, FFNET) it
  supports some unusual sources like LiveJournal, Project Gutenberg and many
  many more. Second in site count only to FanFicFare. [(Perl)](https://github.com/rubykat/WWW-FetchStory)

## OTHER DOCS

If you realllly, want to, docs on the internal API [are available](API.md).

## FOR FUN

So, with the addition of proper Scrivener support, I now have my publishing
pipeline entirely automated.  I run a small shell script that updates the
metadata from Scrivener and then produces a copy of my fic as:

* epub, mobi, pdf, bbcode, AO3's HTML, FFNet's HTML and plain HTML

I'm using calibre to produce the mobi and pdf.  The args passed into the pdf
generator are mostly about getting something that looks passable on desktop.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
EBOOK_CONVERT=/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert

ff update expiation.fic.toml && \
ff generate expiation.fic.toml && \
$EBOOK_CONVERT expiation.epub expiation.mobi --output-profile=kindle_voyage &&\
$EBOOK_CONVERT expiation.epub expiation.pdf  --output-profile=tablet \
  --margin-bottom=72 --margin-left=72 --margin-right=72 --margin-top=64 \
  --paper-size letter --pdf-default-font-size 15 --pdf-mono-font-size 10 --pdf-serif-family Palatino \
  --preserve-cover-aspect-ratio \
  && \
rm -fr expiation.bbcode && ff generate expiation.fic.toml -o bbcode && \
rm -fr expiation.ao3 && ff generate expiation.fic.toml -o ao3 && \
rm -fr expiation.ffnet && ff generate expiation.fic.toml -o ffnet && \
rm -fr expiation.html && ff generate expiation.fic.toml -o html
```
